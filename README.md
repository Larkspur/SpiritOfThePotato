This website is actually haunted by the spirit of a potato. THE potato. So be warned. (Evil laugh) <br><br><br>
To prove to you the power of the potato, I'll tell you a true story... <br><br>
*Once, someone wrote on a piece of paper:* <br> <dd>Die, Potato!</dd> <br> The next day, this is what the paper looked like. <br>
<dd>~~Die, Potato!~~</dd> <br> And the person who wrote it didn't change it at all. It was sitting on his desk all night. So who did it? <br>
